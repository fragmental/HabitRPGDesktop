=======

A HabitRPG client built using the Unity Game Engine

The client is currently closed source.  I created this repository to help with coordinating efforts.  If you are interested in helping with the project, send me a message or e-mail, or post to this issue https://github.com/fragmental/habit3d/issues/1.
